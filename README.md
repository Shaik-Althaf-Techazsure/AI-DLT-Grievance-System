**RTGS V2.0: The Trust Ledger (AI & DLT Grievance System)**

**Ending Fake Government Closures**

This project is a comprehensive, multi-modal, multi-lingual grievance redressal system built for the Andhra Pradesh government (RTGS) to address the critical lack of transparency and trust caused by fraudulent resolution claims.

We leverage Gemini AI for intelligent intake and use Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) to provide publicly auditable proof that a complaint has been physically and correctly resolved.
